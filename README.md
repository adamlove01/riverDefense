## Intro

This game was a student project at triOS College, London, Ontario in December 2013. It demonstrates the use of HTML5 canvas to build a browser-based tower defense game. Several levels are programmed but the game is not play-tested in any way - it's just a proof of concept.

## Issues

Weird things happen after level 10 as I did not get that far.

## Contribution

Andrew Temple contributed some of the jQuery code as this was a team project but I designed the game, artwork and maybe 90% of the code, and I rewrote the code after handing in the project.
